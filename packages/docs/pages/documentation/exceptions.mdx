# Exceptions

Kaito ships custom exceptions that can be thrown from any route. This can save a lot of boilerplate, making your code
more readable & maintainable.

## `Errors`

### `NotFoundException`

You can throw this error if you want to easily return a `404` status to the user.

### `ValidationException`

You can throw this error if you want to inform the user that a request body, query or params were invalid.

### `HttpException`

An exception that takes a status code & a single or array of messages to send back to the user.
It can be used in the following manner

```ts
const existingUser = await findUser();
if (!existingUser) throw new HttpException(409, 'That user already exists');
```
