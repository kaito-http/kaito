# Schemas

Kaito has rich integration with [zod](https://npmjs.org/package/zod), the schema validation library.
It's easy to use with Kaito.

## Basic Usage

```ts
import { Post, Schema, KRT, InferType } from "@kaito-http/core";
import * as z from 'zod';

const testingSchema = z.object({ name: z.string() });

@Post("/post")
@Schema(testingSchema)
async post(ctx: InferType<typeof testingSchema>): KRT<{ name: string }> {
  return ctx.body;
}
```

In this method, Kaito is parsing the incoming body from the request and validating it with Zod. If the schema is
invalid, an error is thrown, and the request finishes before your class method is even called. A list of errors is
then sent back to the sender.

It would be wise to abstract the schemas into another file, for reuse across your app.
