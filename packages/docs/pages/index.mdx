# Introduction

## Warning

The API is extremely open for changes right now as we're deciding the best implementation for Kaito.
We wouldn't recommend using this for a future project unless you enjoy broken code. Some people do.

### Features

- ✍ built in zod schema + body validation support
- ⚡ ultra quick. faster than express, built on top of [tinyhttp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tinyhttp/app)
- 💪 robust
- 💨 extremely easy to use, built with decorators

## What is Kaito?

Kaito is a minimalistic, HTTP framework for Node.js and TypeScript. It can also work in JavaScript environments, but
this may change in the future.

<Callout emoji="⚠">Kaito is not production ready, please use it with caution</Callout>

### What is Kaito not?

Kaito is not:

- Stable
- Battle tested
- For writing really low amounts of code - for now. We'll eventually have a solid API for writing very little code

## What's planned?

In hopefully chronological order...

- Middleware
- Easy JWT management
- Type-safe sessions (for singleton servers)
- Database support (wanting to create a rich integration with [Prisma](https://prisma.io))
- Support for child & parent controllers
