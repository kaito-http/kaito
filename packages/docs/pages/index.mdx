# Introduction

## Warning

The API is extremely open for changes right now as we're deciding the best implementation for Kaito.
We wouldn't recommend using this for a future project unless you enjoy broken code. Some people do.

### Features

- ✍ built in schema + body validation support
- ⚡ ultra quick, built on top of [polka](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polka)
- 💪 robust
- 💨 extremely easy to use, built with decorators

## What is Kaito

Kaito is a minimalistic, HTTP framework for Node.js and TypeScript. It can also work in JavaScript environments, but
this may change in the future.
