# Reading the client IP address

Getting the client IP address in Kaito differs depending on what server runtime you're using and also if you are using a reverse proxy or not.

For example, if you are using a reverse proxy like Cloudflare, you'll need to use the `cf-connecting-ip` header to get the client IP address.

## Cloudflare proxy example

```ts
export const router = create({
	getContext: async req => ({req}),
});

export const myRouter = router.get('/ip', async ({ctx}) => {
	const ip = ctx.req.headers.get('cf-connecting-ip'); // you must pass `.req` in your context object

	if (!ip) {
		throw new KaitoError(400, 'Probably not behind Cloudflare!');
	}

	return ip;
});
```

Other reverse proxies will have different headers, nginx for example uses `x-forwarded-for`. Consult the docs of your reverse proxy to see how to get the client IP address.

In most cases, apps ARE behind reverse proxies, and it's rare that you'll want the IP address of the connection itself. If you actually do need it, you'll have to consult the docs of your server runtime. Below are a couple snippets that may be helpful, though.

## Bun

With `Bun.serve()`, you can access the client IP address with the server's `.remoteIP` method. We recommend storing this in AsyncLocalStorage so you can access it in your route handlers.

Bear in mind that you can move the ip property to your context object to make it cleaner to access. Below is just a lightweight example.

```ts
import {AsyncLocalStorage} from 'node:async_hooks';
import {create} from '@kaito-http/core';

const ipStore = new AsyncLocalStorage<string>();

const router = create();

const app = router.get('/ip', async ({ctx}) => {
	const ip = ipStore.getStore()!;
	return ip;
});

const handle = router.serve();

const server = Bun.serve({
	port: 3000,
	fetch: async (request, server) => {
		const ip = server.remoteIP(request);
		return ipStore.run(ip, () => handle(request));
	},
});
```

## Node.js

Since you'll be using `@kaito-http/uws` with Node.js, you can use the exported function `getRemoteAddress` to get the client IP address. Like the Bun example above, this also uses AsyncLocalStorage under the hood. The `getRemoteAddress` is a wrapper around the `getRemoteAddressAsText` function that comes from uWebSockets.js directly.

```ts
import {getRemoteAddress} from '@kaito-http/uws';

const app = router.get('/ip', async ({ctx}) => {
	const ip = getRemoteAddress(); // Will "just work" in Node.js, as long as you are using KaitoServer
	return ip;
});
```

If you're not using Bun or Node.js, you should consult the docs of your server runtime to see how to get the client IP address. We'll happily accept a PR to this docs page to add snippets for other server runtimes.

### Kaito v1 & v2

Previous versions of Kaito were built on top of Node.js only, so you could just access the `req.socket.remoteAddress` property to get the client's IP address. The Web Fetch API doesn't have a `.socket` property on requests, so most server implementations let you access the remote ip address or socket instance (if any) through other means.
