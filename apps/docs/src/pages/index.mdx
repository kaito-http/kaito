# Kaito

Kaito is a seriously good HTTP Server Framework for TypeScript. It works with many runtimes, including Bun, Node, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, & more. It's based on the modern Web Fetch API using Request/Response objects.

### Features

- 🪶 Zero runtime dependencies
- ✍ Batteries-included OpenAPI support with runtime validation
- 🧑‍💻 Insane TypeScript support, with full e2e type safety to your client
- ⚡ Stupidly fast, built for performance and is often many times faster than other frameworks
- 💨 Very intuitive & composable API, only need to learn a few concepts and the rest falls into place
- 📦 Absolutely tiny package size, making it ideal for serverless environments
- 🏎️ Streaming support with built-in utilities for doing server-sent events (SSE)

### The client

Kaito has an optional client library that is built on top of the Fetch API. It works great in the browser and also in any server runtime! The client can import the TypeScript definition of your server and allow for full e2e type safety.

This means url paths, query params, request body, and response body are all fully typed. You can break things in the backend and know exactly what needs to be fixed in the frontend. It's truly the best way to build a full stack application with TypeScript everywhere.

### Why Kaito?

The most popular HTTP Server frameworks on npm are all built for Node.js, and are all similar iterations of a very dated pattern that was popularized by Express.js. Kaito is different. We've reimagined what a modern HTTP Server Framework should be, and we've built it from the ground up to be the best possible experience for TypeScript developers.
