# Streaming

Kaito supports streaming out of the box we let you return a `Response` with a `ReadableStream` body, but we also have built-in utilities for doing server-sent events (SSE).

## SSE

SSE is a technology that allows you to stream data to the client in realtime. It's a very simple protocol. You can [learn about it on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).

Kaito has a built-in utility for doing SSE, called `sse`. This function returns a `Response` object that you can return from your route.

```ts
const stream = router.get('/', async ({ctx}) => {
	return sse(async function* () {
		yield {data: 'Hello, world!'};
		await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
		yield {data: 'Hello, world!'};
	});
});
```

## Basic streaming

You can also just return a response with a `ReadableStream` body.

```ts
router.get('/', async () => {
	const stream = new ReadableStream<string>({
		async start(controller) {
			controller.enqueue('Hello, ');
			await sleep(1000);
			controller.enqueue('world!');
			await sleep(1000);
			controller.close();
		},
	});

	return new Response(stream, {
		headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'},
	});
});
```
