# router.serve(): the handler

The `create()` function is the main entry point to Kaito. It creates a new router instance with your configuration and returns it.

```ts
import {create} from '@kaito-http/core';

export const router = create({
	getContext,
	onError,
});

const handle = router.serve();
Bun.serve({fetch: handle, port: 3000});
```

## `onError`

In the example above we have included the property `onError`. This is a function that is called whenever an error is thrown in the request lifecycle. This function should reply with an object that contains a `status` and `message`. These will be used to reply to the client.

```ts
import {create} from '@kaito-http/core';
import {ZodError} from 'zod';

export const router = create({
	onError: async (error, req) => {
		if (error instanceof ZodError) {
			return {status: 400, message: 'Invalid request'};
		}

		return {status: 500, message: 'Internal Server Error'};
	},
	// ...
});
```

## Before/Transform

Kaito has a basic lifecycle for transform/intercepting requests and responses. The most common use case is to add CORS headers.

- `.before()` runs before the router is handled. You can return early here to stop the request from being handled by the router.
- `.transform()` runs on EVERY response. That includes ones from `.before()` and ones from the router.

```ts
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://app.example.com'];

export const router = create({
	getContext,
	before: async req => {
		if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
			return new Response(null, {status: 204}); // Return early to skip the router. This response will be passed to `.transform()`
		}
	},

	transform: async (request, response) => {
		const origin = request.headers.get('origin');

		// Include CORS headers if the origin is allowed
		if (origin && ALLOWED_ORIGINS.includes(origin)) {
			response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
			response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
			response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
			response.headers.set('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400');
			response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
		}
	},
});
```

You can also return a response inside of `.transform()` as well, but we find that there are few use cases for this. Most of the time you'll only be mutating headers.

This feature was called Before/After in Kaito v2. The functionality has changed a little bit, so migrating to v3 might require some changes.
