# Routers

Routers are a collection of routes and their metadata. They can be merged together to allow for separating logic into different files.

- Routers are immutable, and all methods return a new router instance
- You chain router methods: `router.post().get()`
- Use `.through()` to change the context instance for all routes defined after the `.through()`

## Creating a Router

You can create a new router using the `create` function from `@kaito-http/core`. This will give you a router instance that you can use to define routes and their behavior.

```ts {1,3-11}
import {create} from '@kaito-http/core';

export const router = create({
	getContext: async (req, head) => {
		// Your context creation logic here
		return {
			// ...context properties
		};
	},
});

const app = router.get(...);
```

And then you are safe to use the router around your app, which will guarantee context type safety.

## Router Merging

Routers can be merged, which brings one router's routes into another, with a prefix. This is incredibly useful for larger apps, for example when you have multiple versions of an API.

```ts {4}
import {v1} from './routers/v1';
import {v2} from './routers/v2';

export const api = router.merge('/v1', v1).merge('/v2', v2);
```

You can expect all type information to be carried over as well as the route names and correct prefixes.

## `.through()`

Kaito takes a different approach to traditional express.js style "middleware." This is mostly because of the inpredictable nature of such a pattern. Kaito offers a superior alternative, `.through()`.

### How to use `.through()`

`.through()` accepts a function that is provided the current context, and should return the next context (learn more about context [here](/documentation/context)). This will swap out the context for all routes defined after the `.through()`. You can also throw any kind of errors inside the callback, and they will be caught and handled as you would expect.

#### Examples

Take the following snippet:

```ts
const postsRouter = router.post('/', async ({ctx}) => {
	// Imagine we wanted to get the current user here. Right now this is not defined anywhere
	const user = ctx.user;

	// ...
});
```

One common reason to reach for `.through()` is to append specific properties to the context, and in our example that will be accessing the session.

```ts
const postsRouter = router
	.through(async ctx => {
		// Just an example. This getSession() method would be
		// defined in the root `getContext` function. Probably
		// would read the cookies and then resolve a session from a database.
		const session = await ctx.getSession();

		if (!session) {
			throw new KaitoError(401, 'You are not logged in');
		}

		return {
			...ctx,
			user: session.user,
		};
	})
	.post('/', async ({ctx}) => {
		// ctx.user is now defined, and correctly typed!
		ctx.user; // => {id: string, name: string, ...}

		await ctx.db.posts.create(ctx.user.id);
	});
```

##### Multiple `.through()` calls

You can call `.through()` multiple times, where each `.through()` will accept the result of the previous call.

```ts
const usersRouter = router
	.through(async ctx => {
		const session = await ctx.getSession();

		if (!session) {
			throw new KaitoError(401, 'You are not logged in');
		}

		return {
			...ctx,
			user: session.user,
		};
	})
	.post('/posts', async ({ctx}) => {
		const post = await ctx.db.posts.create(ctx.user.id);
		return post;
	})
	.through(async ctx => {
		// ctx.user is guaranteed to exist here, because of the previous `.through()`
		const checkIfUserIsAdmin = await checkIfUserIsAdmin(ctx.user);

		if (!checkIfUserIsAdmin) {
			throw new KaitoError(403, 'Forbidden');
		}

		return {
			...ctx,
			user: {
				...ctx.user,
				isAdmin: true,
			},
		};
	})
	.delete('/posts', async ({ctx, body, query, params}) => {
		ctx.user.isAdmin; // => true
		await deleteAllPosts();
	});
```

## Composition

A nice pattern that `.through()` enables is to export a router from another file that already has some 'through-logic' applied to it. This allows for extremely powerful composition of routers.

```ts filename="routers/authed.ts"
export const authedRouter = router.through(async ctx => {
	const session = await ctx.getSession();

	if (!session) {
		throw new KaitoError(401, 'You are not logged in');
	}

	return {
		...ctx,
		user: session.user,
	};
});
```

```ts filename="routes/posts.ts"
import {authedRouter} from '../routers/authed.ts';

// Note: I am not calling calling authedRouter here. All router methods are immutable
// so we can just import the router and use it as is, rather than instantiating it again
// for the sake of some syntax
export const postsRouter = authedRouter.post('/', async ({ctx}) => {
	// There is now NO .through() logic here, but we still
	// get access to a strongly typed `ctx.user` object! Incredible right?
	await ctx.db.posts.create(ctx.user.id);
});
```
