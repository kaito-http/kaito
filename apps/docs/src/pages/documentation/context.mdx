# Context

In Kaito, context is information shared to every single route. It's provided at the root of your application and is generated on every single request.

Below is an example of things that you could include, but it's really up to you and what you would find useful to include in your app.

In the documentation about routers, you'll learn about how routers can create their own context for enabling powerful separation of concerns.

<Callout>
	Passing the request/response objects to context is ok, but we firmly recommend you read the
	[routes](/documentation/routes) documentation for information on the Request/Response model.
</Callout>

```ts filename="context.ts"
import {create} from '@kaito-http/core';
import {db} from './db.ts';

// Create a new router with context
export const router = create({
	getContext: async (req, head) => {
		return {
			req,
			res,
			time: new Date(),

			searchForUser: async (query: string) => {
				return await db.users.search(query);
			},

			// This is just an example
			getSession: async () => {
				const cookies = req.headers.cookie;

				// this is bad code, use a cookie parser library! npmjs.com/package/cookie is a good one
				const token = cookies
					?.split(';')
					.find(cookie => cookie.startsWith('token='))
					.split('=')[1];

				return await db.sessions.findByToken(token);
			},
		};
	},
});
```

You can then use this context, when setup correctly with a router, inside every single route. E.g.

```ts filename="routes/users.ts"
import {z} from 'zod';
import {router} from '../context.ts';

export const users = router.get('/users/search', {
	query: {
		search: z.string().max(200),
	},

	async run({ctx, query}) {
		const users = await ctx.searchForUser(query.search);
		return users;
	},
});
```
