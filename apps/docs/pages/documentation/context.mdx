# Context

In Kaito, context is information shared to every single route. It's provided at the root of your application and is generated on every single request.

For example, if you want to provide the `req` and `res` objects to each route, you should add it to your context.

Below is an example of things that you could include, but it's really up to you and what you would find useful to include in your app.

It's important to note that passing the response object is potentially harmful. This is because a developer could misuse it and start overwriting headers or sending data to the client in a way that you didn't intend. Instead, I'd recommend only passing as few values as needed. If you needed access to cookies, perhaps provide a `getCookie(name: string)` method, or something similar. This is by principle of least privilege.

```ts
import {createUtilities} from '@kaito-http/core';

// Use the `createUtilities` helper to also create a `router` function, and all nicely typed
export const {getContext, router} = createUtilities(async (req, res) => {
	return {
		req,
		res,
		time: new Date(),

		// Example implementing some database resources
		users: {
			async search(query: string) {
				//
			},

			async byId(id: string) {
				//
			},
		},

		sessions: {
			async create(userId: string) {
				//
			},

			async resolve() {
				return req.headers.authorization;
			},
		},
	};
});
```

You can then use this context, when setup correctly with a router, inside every single route. E.g.

```ts
import {z} from 'zod';
import {router} from './context';

export const users = router().get('/users', {
	query: {
		search: z.string(),
	},

	async run({ctx, query}) {
		return ctx.users.search(query.search);
	},
});
```
