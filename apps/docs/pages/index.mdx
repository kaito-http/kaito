- ✍ Built in zod schema + body validation support
- ⚡ Ultra quick. Faster than Express
- 💪 Robust
- 💨 Extremely easy to use, functional pattern
- 📦 Tiny, with only 4 small dependencies

## Principles

- No middleware! I've always disliked the middleware pattern, for two reasons. The first is that it's difficult to make guarantees about where and the order that middleware run, and secondly it's hard to provide robust type information for middleware. **Instead**, Kaito offers a `.through()` method that allows you to perform logic and swap out context before the request is handled. Read more about that [here](/documentation/routers#through-middleware-alternative).
- JSON only. This makes it über easy to build an API without having to think about what's happening behind the scenes
- e2e types. Kaito supports exporting the entire API as a TypeScript interfaces, including all response types. This allows for easy building of a client
